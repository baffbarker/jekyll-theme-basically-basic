Right then,

This is my debut blog post. The learning curve just to get to this point was Everest-like. The journey I took to get this first post into your inbox, kind reader if you will take the time to share a minute with me, was considerable and not without intellectual hardship.

I've kind of left "social media" since in my opinion the Internet which meant huge things to me has morphed out of control from the exciting liberating experience it once was for me in a sweaty office in Bangor University in 1988 where I sent my first email, to the oppressive, commercialised trollfest surveillance swamp it is today. This is my humble attempt to Drain the internet Swamp. The difference is I am the author of every single word on here. I own the words. Yet not only that...

The blog, which is entirely self-programmed, contains under each post a comment section which I'm keen to get running. That's also moderated by me, so no unsavoury stuff can get through! The only rule down there is - keep it entertaining!
